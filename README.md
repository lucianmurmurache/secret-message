## Secret Message

### Send secret messages

### The way this works is by decoding a base-64 encoded string, the encoded string is placed in the URL and then decoded once the link is accessed.

### A demo app is available [here](https://secret-message-green.vercel.app/)

- The color theme will adjust based on your browser theme

### Installation instructions:

- There is no need to install anything, the app is quite simple and uses materializecss CDN so there are no dependencies required

### Hosting the app on Vercel:

- Register on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- In your terminal run `npx now`
- You will be asked to login
- After logging in, run the same command again, choose hosting and select your preferences
- You will see the project in your _Vercel_ dashboard
